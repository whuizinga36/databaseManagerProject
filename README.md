Station manager for internship over summer 2023. The company I worked for rents out machines to hospitals, and this system is designed to track them. The code is modified from the original system. First, I removed information that connects to any databases or any other sensitive information. There were also a lot of notes for brainstorming future ideas for the system, which have also been removed since they are not relevent to the existing system.
